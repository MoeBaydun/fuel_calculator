**Fuel Cost Calculator**
Key Elements of the Design:
Text Instructions: At the top of the screen, explaining the app's purpose and providing an example.
Input Fields: For fuel efficiency, fuel cost, and vehicle count.
Trip Segments Section: Input fields for each segment's distance.
Buttons: A button for adding new segments, calculating the total cost, and resetting the form.
Results Card: To display the total cost and per-person cost.

**Project Information:**
The project was completed by Mohamad Baydoun ID: 12230004 and Nour Sleiman ID: 72230796. 
This application was developed to calculate fuel efficiency for trips that involve multiple segments (or stops).

**Main Functionalities:**
1. Reset Button:
   The Reset button clears all input fields and resets the variables, allowing the user to start fresh.
   This ensures that the app is in a clean state before entering new data for another trip.

2. Calculate Button:
   When the Calculate button is pressed, the app calculates the total fuel cost for the trip based on the following inputs:
   Fuel efficiency of the vehicle (km per liter).
   Fuel cost per liter.
   Distances of each trip segment.
   The app calculates the fuel needed for each segment and the cost per segment.
   Then, it computes the total fuel cost, accounting for the number of vehicles and passengers involved. The calculated total cost is displayed on the screen.

3. Trip Segments (Multiple Stops):
   The app supports multiple trip segments (or stops). For each segment:
   Users can enter the distance for that segment.
   The app calculates the fuel required for each segment based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency.
   Users can add as many segments as needed, and the app will dynamically update the results based on the input distances and other data.
